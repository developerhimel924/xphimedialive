The Color of the Cross Tribute delivers on its mission to glorify Ad’am the beloved son of Elohim. This revelation is felt through out this record in the brilliant awe-inspiring songs, Lord of lords and King of kings, You gave your life, I thank you, and the prophetic song The night Yah come. Just a few of the fantastic songs from this must have album."
